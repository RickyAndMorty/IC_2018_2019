This work utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to control the signal ratio plus interference in next generation passive optical networks (NG-PON)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an extensive scientific discipline which enables computer systems to solve problems by emulating complex biological proccess such as learning, reasoning and self-correction. 

This approach utilizes the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm) to solve the problem of resource allocation in passive optical networks.
