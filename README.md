This work uses artificial intelligence (AI) to control the signal-to-noise ratio plus interference in next-generation passive optical networks (NG-PON).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an extensive scientific discipline which enables computer systems to solve problems by emulating complex biological proccess such as learning, reasoning and self-correction. 

A stride forward towards making agents more intelligent comes by incorporating the use of knowledge, reasoning and planning. In this case, intelligent agents keep a knowledge base (KB) where relevant knowledge about the environment and about the impact of their actions is stored. 

This approach utilizes the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm) to solve the problem of resource allocation in passive optical networks.
